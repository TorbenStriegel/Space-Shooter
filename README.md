# Space-Shooter-Reloaded

## Project Overview
Space-Shooter-Reloaded is a project developed during school years in Java. It is a classic space shooter game where you pilot a spaceship, defeat enemies, and strive to achieve the highest possible score. The game features time-limited levels, and you lose when you run out of lives. The levels are procedurally generated.

## Instructions
**Space Invader**, or here, **Space Shooter**, is one of the earliest video games, first released in 1978. It falls under the category of "shoot-'em-up" video games, and to this day, there are hundreds of thousands of remakes of this classic game. The objective of the game is not only to survive but also to attain the highest possible score to climb the leaderboard.

### Controls
In the game, you control a spaceship that you can choose at the beginning. You move the spaceship using the arrow keys (up, down, right, left) and shoot with the spacebar. You can move the spaceship across the entire screen, but try to avoid colliding with other ships. If you need to pause the game, simply use the pause button ("P"). To exit the program during gameplay, press the Esc key.

### Levels
As in many games, there are levels that you need to unlock to play them. On the start screen, you can see how many levels you have unlocked so far. To unlock a new level, you must successfully complete the previous level (For example, to play Level 6, you need to complete Level 5 successfully). You pass a level when you survive the given time, which can vary from level to level, without losing all your lives. (Note: The shield is a bonus; you can pass the level even if you lose your shield completely!)

### Spaceships
In the game, you have multiple different spaceships to choose from. Each spaceship has its strengths and weaknesses, which you can check in the start menu. Discover which spaceship suits you best and which one is ideal for specific levels. Sometimes speed is crucial, but damage can also be of great importance in certain levels. As with levels, you need to unlock spaceships by collecting green icons during levels.

### Shield
Each spaceship has its own shield. The shield absorbs the damage you take. It regenerates every 8 seconds (Note: the shield does not regenerate at the same speed for every spaceship!). The shield is only in front of you; anything that hits you outside the shield's range directly damages your spaceship and is not intercepted by the shield.

### Enemies
Similar to spaceships, enemies also have strengths and weaknesses. Figure out which ones to watch out for and how to defeat them best. Some can be destroyed with one or two hits, while others may require more effort. Make sure the number of enemy ships doesn't get too large, as avoiding them becomes nearly impossible. If an enemy gets through, it won't count negatively. The goal of the game is not to let no enemies pass but to destroy as many enemy ships as possible.

### Score
Your score is one of the most crucial aspects of the game, as it determines your ranking on the leaderboard. (A ranking entry is only made if you successfully complete the level!) You primarily earn points by destroying enemies, but it's essential to avoid shooting aimlessly, as better accuracy leads to additional points. (Your current score, obtained from destroyed enemy units, is multiplied by the accuracy score. With an accuracy score of 50%, you would have 1.5 times your score.) Points are deducted when you collide with an enemy or get hit by a shot. At the end of each successful game, your achieved rank is displayed. Aim to be in the top 10 to become visible to other players and become one of the best space pilots in the universe.

### Bonus Items
Bonus items appear in every level, but their frequency varies. Collect them to temporarily enhance your abilities or repair your spaceship or shield.

- **Speed Boost**: Allows you to move exceptionally fast for a short time. Be careful to dodge enemies effectively even when speeding.
- **Fire Rate Increase**: Significantly increases your firing rate. Use it to create some space.
- **Shield Regeneration**: Partially replenishes your shield.
- **Heart**: The only way to regain lost lives and survive longer in space.
- **New Spaceship**: Unlocks another new spaceship.
